                                    There is a concerning trend in global poverty, exacerbated by the COVID-19
                                    pandemic, which has halted decades of progress in poverty reduction. It predicts
                                    that by 2030, approximately 575 million people will still be living in extreme
                                    poverty, particularly challenging in sub-Saharan Africa and conflict-affected
                                    regions. Despite some expansion in social protection during the pandemic, over 4
                                    billion people globally remain without adequate coverage. Historical trends
                                    suggest only one-third of countries will halve their national poverty rates by
                                    2030, and social protection coverage remains insufficient for various vulnerable
                                    groups. To effectively combat poverty, there's a call for increased action and
                                    investment in job creation and social services, emphasizing the need to redirect
                                    public resources toward essential services.

                                    There is an escalating issue of hunger and food insecurity worldwide, with the
                                    number of affected individuals rising steadily since 2015, exacerbated by
                                    factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict, climate change, and inequality.
                                    Despite global efforts, projections suggest that by 2030, approximately 670
                                    million people will still face hunger, equal to the number in 2015. Challenges
                                    persist in reducing malnutrition among children, necessitating a 2.2-fold
                                    increase in the current rate of reduction in stunting to meet global targets.
                                    Urgent action is required to transform food systems, enhance food security, and
                                    invest in sustainable agricultural practices to achieve zero hunger by 2030.
                                    Additionally, various targets address issues such as the increase in food
                                    insecurity due to the pandemic, the stagnation in reducing overweight children,
                                    declining investments in agriculture, the elimination of agricultural export
                                    subsidies, and the ongoing challenge of fluctuating food prices, especially in
                                    sub-Saharan Africa and least developed countries.

                                    It is noted that the challenges facing the achievement of Sustainable
                                    Development Goal 3 (SDG3), exacerbated by the pandemic and ongoing crises, lead
                                    to a rise in health inequalities and threatening universal health coverage.
                                    Notably, there's an alarming increase in the number of un- or under-vaccinated
                                    children, especially in low- and middle-income countries, alongside a slow
                                    decline in maternal mortality rates and under-5 mortality rates, with urgent
                                    efforts required to meet the 2030 targets. Progress towards ending communicable
                                    diseases remains off track, with setbacks observed in reducing HIV infections,
                                    TB, and malaria cases. Additionally, there's a need to bolster health systems
                                    and address the shortage of health workers, especially in regions with high
                                    disease burdens. Efforts to enhance family planning services and childhood
                                    vaccinations also require immediate attention to ensure universal access to
                                    healthcare services.

                                    COVID-19 pandemic, which has further disrupted progress. Without additional
                                    measures, only a small fraction of countries will meet Sustainable Development
                                    Goal 4 (SDG4) by 2030, leaving millions of children without access to quality
                                    education and lacking essential numeracy and literacy skills. Despite some
                                    improvements in school completion rates, progress has slowed, and learning
                                    levels have stagnated, with documented losses due to pandemic-related school
                                    closures. Access to pre-primary education remains limited, and participation in
                                    education and training for youth and adults is insufficient. Basic school
                                    infrastructure and teacher qualifications are also highlighted as areas needing
                                    attention. Reimagining education systems and prioritizing education financing
                                    are crucial for achieving SDG4 effectively.

                                    The recovery of the manufacturing industry from COVID-19 is varied, with
                                    high-income regions reaching record levels of manufacturing value added (MVA)
                                    per capita in 2022, while levels in least developed countries (LDCs) remained
                                    close to the 2015 baseline. Higher-technology industries recovered faster,
                                    indicating the importance of promoting innovation and technology transfer. To
                                    achieve Goal 9 by 2030, it is crucial to support LDCs, invest in advanced
                                    technologies, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance global mobile broadband
                                    access. Despite global manufacturing employment returning to pre-pandemic levels

                                    Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the incomes of the bottom 40% of the population
                                    were increasing faster than the national average in many countries, contributing
                                    to a reduction in income inequality. However, the pandemic and subsequent uneven
                                    recoveries across regions threaten to reverse this trend and exacerbate global
                                    inequality. Record numbers of people are fleeing conflicts and economic
                                    hardship, with one in 251 people worldwide being a refugee by mid-2022, the
                                    highest proportion ever documented. Achieving SDG 10 requires addressing the
                                    root causes of wage disparities and access to resources within and between
                                    countries. Despite some progress, challenges remain, such as the persistence of
                                    a high share of people living below half the median income in many countries and
                                    a decline in the share of economic output earned by workers over the past
                                    decade. Additionally, the global average cost of sending remittances remains
                                    high, exceeding the SDG target.

                                    The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant shifts in migration patterns,
                                    impacting urban areas disproportionately and hindering progress towards
                                    sustainable cities. The number of people living in slums or slum-like conditions
                                    in urban areas has been steadily growing, exacerbating the housing crisis,
                                    particularly in developing countries. Access to public transportation remains
                                    inadequate for over half of the world's urban population, and the physical
                                    expansion of cities outpaces population growth, highlighting challenges in urban
                                    planning. Waste management also remains a concern, with a significant portion of

                                    capacities, improving public transportation access, enhancing waste management
                                    systems, and increasing the proportion of open public spaces in cities.
                                    Additionally, increasing the number of countries with local governments equipped
                                    with disaster risk reduction strategies is crucial for building resilience in

                                    which have altered consumption and production patterns. There is an urgent need
                                    for responsible consumption and production practices to be integrated into the
                                    pandemic recovery efforts, alongside accelerating the decoupling of economic
                                    growth from resource use. While reporting on corporate sustainability has
                                    increased significantly since the start of the SDG period, there is room for
                                    improvement, particularly in reporting activities contributing to the SDGs. Key
                                    policies supporting the transition to sustainable practices have been
                                    implemented, but there are regional disparities in reporting and progress.
                                    Despite efforts, post-harvest food losses remain stagnant, far from the goal of
                                    halving them by 2030. Additionally, fossil fuel subsidies have risen, posing a
                                    challenge to sustainability efforts. To achieve SDG12, robust policies promoting
                                    sustainable practices and reducing resource use are essential.

                                    within this decade to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions across all
                                    sectors to meet the 1.5°C target. Failure to act risks the lives of billions of
                                    people, leading to worsening heatwaves, droughts, floods, wildfires, sea-level
                                    rise, and famines. Emissions must be nearly halved by 2030 to combat climate
                                    change effectively. Despite some progress in disaster risk reduction strategies
                                    and climate finance, global temperatures have already exceeded 1.1°C, and

                                    Terrestrial ecosystems are under immense pressure from human activities, leading
                                    to biodiversity loss, deforestation, desertification, and land degradation.
                                    Despite efforts to expand protected areas and combat illegal wildlife trade,
                                    global biodiversity is declining at an alarming rate. Urgent and transformative
                                    action is needed to reverse these trends and achieve SDG 15 targets. However,
                                    current progress remains insufficient, with biodiversity loss continuing
                                    unabated, and over 25% of species assessed are at risk of extinction.
                                    Additionally, deforestation rates have increased in some regions, and
                                    desertification and land degradation are ongoing challenges. Concerted efforts
                                    are needed to restore degraded ecosystems, protect endangered species, and
                                    promote sustainable land use practices to safeguard terrestrial biodiversity and
                                    achieve SDG 15.

                                    Despite progress in some areas, significant challenges remain in achieving
                                    peaceful, just, and inclusive societies worldwide. Conflict, violence, and
                                    insecurity continue to threaten progress, with over 22 million people displaced
                                    due to conflict or persecution by mid-2022. Additionally, progress towards
                                    reducing homicide rates and ensuring access to justice remains slow,
                                    particularly in conflict-affected regions. Strengthening the rule of law,
                                    promoting accountable institutions, and fostering inclusive governance are
                                    essential for achieving SDG 16 targets. However, civic space continues to shrink
                                    globally, with increasing restrictions on freedom of expression, association,
                                    and peaceful assembly. Upholding human rights, promoting gender equality, and
                                    combating corruption are critical for building peaceful and inclusive societies
                                    and advancing sustainable development.

                                    Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires effective
                                    implementation strategies, robust partnerships, and sufficient financing.
                                    Despite some progress, global efforts to mobilize resources for sustainable
                                    development have been inadequate, with developing countries facing significant
                                    challenges in accessing finance and technology transfer. Strengthening the means
                                    of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable
                                    development are crucial for accelerating progress towards the SDGs. However, ODA
                                    disbursements have declined in recent years, and the global response to the
                                    COVID-19 pandemic has further strained limited resources. Enhancing
                                    international cooperation, promoting innovative financing mechanisms, and
                                    fostering inclusive partnerships are essential for achieving the SDGs by 2030.
                                    Additionally, addressing systemic barriers, such as debt sustainability and
                                    trade restrictions, is necessary to ensure equitable and sustainable development
                                    for all.
